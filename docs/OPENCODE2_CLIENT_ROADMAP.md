# OpenCode 2 Client Feature Roadmap

> **Status:** active implementation backlog for the OpenCode 2 client.
>
> GitHub issues and pull requests are canonical for scope and implementation. This document tracks sequencing, dependencies, and overall progress.

## Goal

Bring the remote OpenCode 2 experience closer to the native client without weakening Harness Remote's web, desktop, Android, multi-agent, or local-first design.

OpenCode owns execution, sessions, plugins, permissions, tools, and credentials. Harness Remote should expose those capabilities remotely with clear state, safe controls, and graceful behavior when a backend cannot provide equivalent data.

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Planned | Scoped in an issue but implementation has not started |
| In progress | An implementation PR is open or active work is underway |
| Blocked | Progress requires an upstream API or another roadmap item |
| Shipped | Merged and available on the default branch |

## Current Baseline

The OpenCode 2 client already supports sessions, streamed messages, prompts, interruption, model and agent selection, commands, questions, permissions, attachments, filesystem browsing, and working-copy diffs.

The remaining work is primarily richer visibility and control. Model execution and agent tools already run on the OpenCode server regardless of which Harness Remote client is connected.

Progress: **4 of 12 shipped**.

## Delivery Phases

### Phase 1: Quick parity wins

Ship small, independently reviewable additions that map directly to OpenCode 2 APIs and existing Harness Remote UI patterns.

- Skills and commands
- Compact and fork
- Import and export
- MCP visibility and management

### Phase 2: Reliable supervision state

Build a durable state model before adding richer multi-agent presentation.

- Reconstructed session todos
- Busy, waiting, failed, completed, and needs-attention states
- Cross-session questions, permissions, failures, and completion inbox

### Phase 3: Rich execution visibility

Improve how agent work and historical results are represented.

- Background subagent and delegated-task hierarchy
- Structured message and tool-part rendering
- Accurate per-message diff research and implementation

### Phase 4: Full remote workspace control

Add larger interactive workflows after supervision state is reliable.

- Authenticated PTY terminal
- Task and worktree creation, execution, review, finish, and safe cleanup

## Implementation Principles

- Keep each feature in its own issue and PR unless a dependency makes separation artificial.
- Prefer documented OpenCode 2 API state over client-side inference.
- Label reconstructed or incomplete state honestly.
- Preserve backend-neutral UI and types where the concept applies to other harnesses.
- Make unsupported capabilities explicit rather than silently degrading behavior.
- Treat web, desktop, and Android behavior as part of acceptance, not follow-up polish.
- Add captured wire fixtures and regression tests because the OpenCode 2 API is experimental.
- Never expose server credentials, provider credentials, or sensitive raw payload fields in the UI.

## Progress Updates

Update this document in the PR that changes an item's status:

1. Mark the item `In progress` when the first implementation PR opens.
2. Link the PR from the feature issue.
3. Mark the item `Shipped` and update the shipped count when the PR merges.
4. Record a short blocker in the issue and mark the item `Blocked` when upstream behavior prevents progress.
5. Add newly discovered work to an existing issue when it belongs to that scope; create a new issue only for an independently deliverable feature.
